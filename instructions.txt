	- The onboard computer on Dark Star.

Setting up the Smack test suite:

Verify you have a Smack enabled kernel:

	$ cat /sys/kernel/security/lsm ; echo
	capability,yama,smack

If "smack" does not appear in the output, you do not have
a Smack enabled kernel. You can determine if Smack is built
in your kernel by looking for "CONFIG_SECURITY_SMACK=y" in
the kernel config file. You should find this in /boot. If
you do not have Smack built in, you will have to build a
new kernel. If Smack is built in, but not enabled, you can
add "security=smack" to the kernel boot line.

You will need socat and ifconfig to support this suite:

	$ sudo dnf install socat net-tools

Get the Smack user space package and install it. You will need
the build tools autoconf and libtoolize. 

	$ pushd ..
	$ sudo dnf install autogen libtool
	$ git clone https://github.com/smack-team/smack.git
	$ cd smack
	$ ./autogen.sh
	$ make
	$ sudo make install
	$ popd

Building the test tools:

	$ make -C tools

Running the Smack test suite:

	$ sudo make test-results
